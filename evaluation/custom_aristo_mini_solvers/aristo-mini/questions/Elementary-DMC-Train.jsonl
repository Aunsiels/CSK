It landed on the flower clusters, and stuck its long tongue into the flowers.

{"id":"MDSA_2007_5_5","question":{"stem":"Use the passage below to answer the question. Free Fall Galileo first introduced the concept of free fall. His classic experiments led to the finding that all objects free fall at the same rate, regardless of their mass. According to legend, Galileo dropped balls of different mass from the Leaning Tower of Pisa to help support his ideas. A freely falling body is an object that is moving under the influence of gravity only. These objects have a downward acceleration toward the center of the earth. Newton later took Galileo's ideas about mechanics and formalized them into his laws of motion. Free-fall rides are really made up of three distinct parts: the ride to the top, the momentary suspension, and the downward plunge. In the first part of the ride, force is applied to the car to lift it to the top of the free-fall tower. The amount of force that must be applied depends on the mass of the car and its passengers. The force is applied by motors, and there is a built-in safety allowance for variations in the mass of the riders. After a brief period in which the riders are suspended in the air, the car suddenly drops and begins to accelerate toward the ground under the influence of the earth's gravity. The plunge seems dramatic. Just as Galileo and Newton explain in their theories of free fall, the least massive and most massive riders fall to the earth with the same rate of acceleration. If the riders were allowed to hit the earth at that speed, coming to a sudden stop at the end of the ride, there would certainly be serious injuries. Ride designers account for this by building an exit track. The car is attached to this track, which gradually curves toward the ground. A stretch of straight track allows the car to slow down and brake, producing a controlled stop at the bottom, that keeps passengers from getting injured.

Space Shuttle Re-entry The space shuttle program uses spaceships to carry humans from Earth to space and back again. It takes a lot of fuel to produce the force needed to lift a space shuttle from Earth to space because the lift force must act against the force of gravity pulling down on the space shuttle. Much less fuel is needed to bring the space shuttle back to Earth. When the astronauts on a space shuttle complete a mission, they use the force of gravity acting on the space shuttle to pull it down from space to Earth's surface. This landing process is not entirely without problems. Once the space shuttle moves from space into Earth's atmosphere, the space shuttle begins to hit air molecules. Although air is a gas, the space shuttle moves so quickly that it hits many air molecules with a great amount of force. Those hits result in friction with the air around the space shuttle. The friction slows the downward motion of the space shuttle and produces a large amount of heat. Because of the heat produced, the space shuttle needs heat-resistant tiles so the inside of the space shuttle does not get too hot as it lands. The heat produced by the friction between the tiles and the atmosphere produces an orange glow as the shuttle moves toward Earth's surface. {img:images/StatesDMC-DA/Maryland/5thGr/Maryland-2010-5-1.png} Which measurement best represents the distance of the orbiting space shuttle from Earth?","choices":[{"text":"300 liters","label":"A"},{"text":"300 seconds","label":"B"},{"text":"300 kilograms","label":"C"},{"text":"300 kilometers","label":"D"}]},"answerKey":"D"}

Rusty Crayfish: A Small Invader Causing Big Problems {img:images/StatesDMC-DA/Maryland/5thGr/Maryland-2011-5-17.png} The rusty crayfish originated in the Ohio River Basin. This invader species began to spread into the Great Lakes regions. They compete with the native crayfish and also, greatly decrease the amount of vegetation, thereby impacting entire food webs. The rusty crayfish have a large eating capacity when consuming aquatic plants. In addition, they eat aquatic insects. When the rusty crayfish reproduce, they can lay 50-575 eggs at one time. Due to their hyper-appetite, rusty crayfish greatly decrease the amount and diversity of plants in aquatic areas, increase competition with native crayfish, and consume an abnormal amount of other aquatic species. When the rusty crayfish invade, they are disrupting the entire ecosystem. The decreased amount of diversity in vegetation affects the population of many other aquatic species in the surrounding ecosystem. Plant beds provide a habitat for invertebrates as well as shelter for many different species of fish. When vegetation is disturbed, all of the species which rely on it have a harder time surviving. Rusty crayfish displace the native species of crayfish from the aquatic ecosystems it invades. In a study of 150 lakes and streams that had been invaded by the rusty crayfish, seventy-five percent had no native crayfish remaining. The displacement occurs through competition for food. Because the \"rusty\" is so aggressive, natives get beat out when feeding and soon their population greatly decreases. As aquatic species disappear, disruption of the food web occurs, which affects all the species in an ecosystem. By introducing rusty crayfish to new ecosystems, they have a great potential to crumble.

Female dragonflies deposit eggs in shallow water, near plants or in soft mud. After the larvae hatch, they live underwater for two to four years. In this time, they shed their exoskeletons eight to fifteen times. The larvae have large lower lips with bristles that can be extended up to one-third of their body length. They consume large quantities of mosquito larvae, water insects, worms, and even small fishes and tadpoles. Once larval growth is complete, they emerge from the water to begin a life in the air. They shed their final exoskeleton to reveal a bright green body, and their wings expand. These dragonflies have large eyes that are capable of seeing nearly 360 degrees (in all directions) and can detect even the slightest movement. They have two sets of wings that work independently of each other, allowing the dragonflies to fly forward, backward, change directions in mid-air, and hover motionless.
