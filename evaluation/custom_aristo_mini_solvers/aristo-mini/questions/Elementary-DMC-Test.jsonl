{"id":"LEAP__5_1","question":{"stem":"Task You are asked to read a science journal describing mixtures containing vinegar. Then you will answer five questions. The first four questions are multiple choice. The last question requires you to write an extended response. Grace and Sierra investigated mixtures containing vinegar. They recorded their investigations in their science journal. Read and study the science journal. Then answer questions 1 through 5. Science Journal-Mixtures with Vinegar Vinegar is a weak acid commonly used in cooking. Vinegar tastes sour. For example, it is what gives the sour taste to oil-and-vinegar-based salad dressings, such as \"Italian\" or \"vinaigrette\" dressings. Today we conducted an investigation to determine the effect of mixing different substances with vinegar. For our experiments, we used apple cider vinegar, which is made from fermented apple juice. It is a gold-colored liquid that pours like water. We followed this procedure for our investigation: 1. We added 30 mL (milliliters) of vinegar to each of five small beakers. 2. We used five additional beakers and added one of the following substances to each: oil, water, milk, salt, and baking soda. 3. We placed a beaker of vinegar and the beaker of oil on an electronic scale. 4. We recorded the total mass. 5. With the beaker of vinegar still on the scale, we poured the oil into the vinegar and put the empty oil beaker back on the scale. 6. We took a photograph of the beaker containing the mixture and made notes about the result. 7. To determine if the mass had changed, we recorded the total mass of everything again. 8. We then repeated steps 3-7 with the remaining four substances. Beaker 1-Vinegar and Oil {img:images/States2017/LA/LA_no_year_5thGr_29.png} The oil floated to the top, above the vinegar. Even after stirring, the oil would float to the top again. The total mass did not change Beaker 2-Vinegar and Water {img:images/States2017/LA/LA_no_year_5thGr_30.png} The water mixed with the vinegar. The resulting liquid was a pale color compared to the vinegar alone. The total mass did not change. Beaker 3-Vinegar and Milk {img:images/States2017/LA/LA_no_year_5thGr_31.png} The milk did not exactly mix with the vinegar. It made these strange, stringy, white blobs that floated throughout the vinegar and settled on the bottom. In the picture, you can see some of the blobs on the surface of the liquid. The total mass did not change. Beaker 4-Vinegar and Salt {img:images/States2017/LA/LA_no_year_5thGr_32.png} At first, the salt settled to the bottom of the beaker. We swirled the beaker a bit, and the vinegar turned cloudy. Soon it became less cloudy and we could not see any salt at all. The vinegar looked about the same as before we added the salt.

They recorded their investigations in their science journal. Read and study the science journal. Then answer questions 1 through 5. Science Journal-Mixtures with Vinegar Vinegar is a weak acid commonly used in cooking. Vinegar tastes sour. For example, it is what gives the sour taste to oil-and-vinegar-based salad dressings, such as \"Italian\" or \"vinaigrette\" dressings. Today we conducted an investigation to determine the effect of mixing different substances with vinegar. For our experiments, we used apple cider vinegar, which is made from fermented apple juice. It is a gold-colored liquid that pours like water. We followed this procedure for our investigation: 1. We added 30 mL (milliliters) of vinegar to each of five small beakers. 2. We used five additional beakers and added one of the following substances to each: oil, water, milk, salt, and baking soda. 3. We placed a beaker of vinegar and the beaker of oil on an electronic scale. 4. We recorded the total mass. 5. With the beaker of vinegar still on the scale, we poured the oil into the vinegar and put the empty oil beaker back on the scale. 6. We took a photograph of the beaker containing the mixture and made notes about the result. 7. To determine if the mass had changed, we recorded the total mass of everything again. 8. We then repeated steps 3-7 with the remaining four substances. Beaker 1-Vinegar and Oil {img:images/States2017/LA/LA_no_year_5thGr_29.png} The oil floated to the top, above the vinegar. Even after stirring, the oil would float to the top again. The total mass did not change Beaker 2-Vinegar and Water {img:images/States2017/LA/LA_no_year_5thGr_30.png} The water mixed with the vinegar. The resulting liquid was a pale color compared to the vinegar alone. The total mass did not change. Beaker 3-Vinegar and Milk {img:images/States2017/LA/LA_no_year_5thGr_31.png} The milk did not exactly mix with the vinegar. It made these strange, stringy, white blobs that floated throughout the vinegar and settled on the bottom. In the picture, you can see some of the blobs on the surface of the liquid. The total mass did not change. Beaker 4-Vinegar and Salt {img:images/States2017/LA/LA_no_year_5thGr_32.png} At first, the salt settled to the bottom of the beaker. We swirled the beaker a bit, and the vinegar turned cloudy. Soon it became less cloudy and we could not see any salt at all. The vinegar looked about the same as before we added the salt. The total mass did not change.

This climbing plant used to be welcome wherever it grew. In the mid-1980s, scientists brought beach vitex, Vitex rotundifolia, from Korea to the United States. They hoped the plant would keep beach sand from blowing away. Beach vitex, which grows wild on ocean beaches in Korea, seemed like the perfect plant for the Carolina beaches.

From the Sand to Sea The hatchling's journey to the water is a race for survival. She is no bigger than a walnut. Crabs and night herons snatch up some of the other hatchlings on the beach. This young turtle makes it to the water. To the Open Ocean The turtle's journey through the open ocean may last several years. Scientists think green sea turtle hatchlings float with mats of sargassum. This seaweed provides a hiding place as well as food. The hatchling may snack on shrimp, small jellyfish and snails that drift in and around the seaweed. Unfortunately, the sea also contains plastic and trash that people throw away. Eating them could be a deadly mistake for the turtle. There are many other dangers in the sea, too. Predators such as sharks swim below the small turtle. Large birds fly above. Growing Up Green The sea turtle's new home is the warm waters along Florida's east coast. With her larger shell, she is safer in the near-shore waters than she was as a hatchling. Eating seagrass and algae has turned her body fat a green color. In fact, this is how green sea turtles get their name! Return Now the adult turtle sets out on a new adventure. She must return to the beach where she was born to lay her eggs. Scientists are still learning how sea turtles find their way through the ocean. They think the turtles may sense changes in Earth's magnetic field. That may help the turtles create a kind of mental map. The Next Generation Out of the water, she struggles to move on land. She reaches a place where high tides will not wash away her eggs. Then she starts to dig. She lays more than 100 leathery white eggs. She packs sand over them. Then she uses her flippers to toss sand to cover her nest. After about two months in the nests, new green sea turtles will hatch. They will begin their own journeys.

Glaciers and People The frozen majesties of Greenland, Alaska, Switzerland and other areas of the world are popular tourist attractions. They're also important natural resources for drinking water, for irrigation of crops, and for generation of electricity. Drinking Water Glaciers contain 75 percent of the world's fresh water supply. Arapaho Glacier in the Rocky Mountains, a small glacier with a length and width of about mile (1.2 km), supplies water for more than 75,000 people who live in the town of Boulder, Colorado. To survive during the dry spells that hit the region of La Paz, Bolivia, the people rely on fresh streams from a nearby mountain glacier. Scientists are studying ways to move icebergs from the cold northern Atlantic Ocean to coastal cities where the icebergs could be used for drinking water. Tugged by boats and helicopters, a berg could be wrapped in plastic to insulate it and prevent it from melting too quickly. Pipes connecting the iceberg to nearby land would allow the fresh water to get to people and crops. Crops Irrigation For hundreds of years, farmers in Switzerland's Rhône Valley have watered their crops with meltwater from glaciers. Electricity Generation In Norway, Canada, New Zealand, and the Alps, glaciologists and engineers have produced electrical power from melting glacial ice.

{"id":"TAKS_2009_5_11","question":{"stem":"Use the information below and your knowledge of science to help you answer the question. Hydroelectric Power People rely on electricity to do many jobs. A source of energy is needed to produce this electricity. Sometimes this energy comes from coal, wind, solar, or nuclear power. It can also come from moving water. Hydroelectric power plants are used to produce electricity from moving water. Water flows naturally in a river, but a dam can make water flow with more force. A dam creates a lake with a large amount of water. Water that is allowed to flow through small tunnels in the dam turns machines called turbines. The movement of the turbines turns a generator that produces electricity. Blocking a river with a dam can affect wildlife. Some types of fish that live in the ocean swim up the river to reproduce. If a dam blocks a river, the fish can no longer swim up the river. This is why some dams are built with a fish ladder. A fish ladder allows fish to swim around a dam and continue up the river. {img:images/StatesDMC-DA/TAKS/5thGr/TX-5-2009-10.png} Moving water has energy.
